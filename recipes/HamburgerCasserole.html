<h2 em strong>Steps to make a Hamburger Casserole</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
  <li>Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef; simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover the skillet.</li>
  <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.</li>
  <li>While the egg noodles are cooking, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
  <li>Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and onion together in a bowl.</li>
  <li>Layer 1/2 of the egg noodles into the prepared casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of the sour cream mixture, then 1/2 of the ground beef mixture. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over top.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
